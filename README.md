FlightOps is a full-stack airline operations and flight discovery platform built for travellers, flight operators and administrators. Travellers can discover routes, review complete flight information and reserve seats through Stripe Checkout. Operators can publish and manage flight listings, while administrators control users, approvals, bookings, payments, messages and audit activity from one workspace.

## Technology stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 App Router, React 19 |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4, responsive CSS animations |
| Forms and validation | React Hook Form, Zod |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose |
| Authentication | JWT with `jose`, HTTP-only cookies, bcryptjs |
| Payments | Stripe Checkout and signed webhooks |
| Charts | Recharts |
| UI feedback | Lucide React, Sonner |
| Deployment | Vercel |

## Application architecture

```text
Browser
  |-- Public pages and flight discovery
  |-- Protected user workspace
  |-- Role-protected Admin Center
  |
Next.js App Router
  |-- React server/client components
  |-- Typed route handlers under /api
  |-- Cookie-based route protection
  |
  |-- MongoDB Atlas: users, flights, bookings, payments,
  |                  messages and audit logs
  `-- Stripe Checkout: payment session and webhook confirmation
```

The project uses a unified Next.js application: UI pages and server-side API route handlers live in the same TypeScript codebase. MongoDB stores persistent business data, while Stripe webhooks provide the authoritative payment result.

## Main routes

| Access | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Public | `/` | Landing page |
| Public | `/flights` | Search, filter, sort and paginate flights |
| Public | `/flights/[id]` | Flight details and related routes |
| Public | `/about`, `/contact` | Company information and contact form |
| Public | `/login`, `/register` | Authentication |
| Public | `/privacy`, `/terms` | Legal pages |
| User | `/dashboard` | Operations overview and charts |
| User | `/flights/add` | Submit a flight |
| User | `/flights/manage` | Manage submitted flights |
| User | `/flights/[id]/book` | Reserve seats and start checkout |
| Admin | `/admin` | Complete administration workspace |

Important API groups include `/api/auth/*`, `/api/flights/*`, `/api/bookings`, `/api/contact`, `/api/dashboard/stats`, `/api/admin/*` and `/api/stripe/*`.

## Database models

- **User:** identity, password hash, role and account status
- **Flight:** route, airline, schedule, fare, capacity, media, owner and approval status
- **Booking:** passenger details, seats, total amount and booking/payment state
- **Payment:** Stripe identifiers, amount, method and settlement state
- **ContactMessage:** verified sender, subject, message and read state
- **AuditLog:** administrator, action, target and timestamp

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js latest LTS
- npm
- MongoDB Atlas database
- Stripe test-mode account for payment testing

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GalibDev/flightops-client.git
cd flightops-client
npm install
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
```

Configure the following values:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://DATABASE_USER:DATABASE_PASSWORD@CLUSTER/flightops
JWT_SECRET=use-a-long-random-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

Never commit `.env.local` or expose database, JWT or Stripe secret keys in client-side code.

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Demo accounts

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| User | `user@flightops.com` | `User123!` |
| Admin | `admin@flightops.com` | `Admin123!` |

Demo accounts provide quick evaluation access. Newly submitted regular-user flights remain pending until an administrator approves them.

## Available scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the local development server |
| `npm run build` | Create an optimised production build |
| `npm start` | Run the production build |
| `npm run typecheck` | Validate TypeScript types |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run seed` | Seed flight data into MongoDB |
| `npm run seed:admin` | Seed stable admin demonstration records |

Before submitting or deploying a change, run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Stripe test checkout

1. Add Stripe test keys to the environment variables.
2. Create a webhook endpoint for `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/stripe/webhook`.
3. Subscribe it to the Checkout completion and payment events used by the application.
4. Add the generated `whsec_...` signing secret as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
5. Redeploy after changing production environment variables.

Use Stripe test cards only while the project is configured with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_` keys. No raw card details are stored by FlightOps.

## Vercel deployment

1. Import the `flightops-client` GitHub repository into Vercel.
2. Add all variables from `.env.example` in **Project Settings > Environment Variables**.
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the production domain.
4. Ensure MongoDB Atlas Network Access allows the deployment to connect and the database user has the required permissions.
5. Deploy, configure the Stripe webhook, add its signing secret, then redeploy once more.

## Security notes

- Passwords are hashed before storage.
- Authentication tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies.
- Protected routes require a valid session; admin APIs additionally verify the admin role.
- Request payloads are validated before database operations.
- Stripe webhook signatures are verified before payment records are updated.
- Administrative mutations create audit records.

## Project status

FlightOps is feature-complete for demonstration and academic submission use. Live airline inventory, production payment processing and transactional email delivery require separate production provider accounts and credentials.
